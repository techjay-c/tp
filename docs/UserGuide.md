**:information_source: Notes about editing tags:**<br>
When editing tags for a patient, ensure to include all existing tags to avoid their removal. For instance, if a patient has 2 tags, use the <code>edit-patient</code> command with 2 tags (e.g., t/TAG1 t/TAG2). 
Replace TAG1 and TAG2 with the desired tags. Note that tags cannot contain spaces. To remove all tags, use t/ in the <code>edit-patient</code> command.

## Troubleshooting

{: .no_toc}
#### Checking your system's Java version
Check that your system has the correct Java version (**Java 11 and above**) installed to run ToothTracker. Follow the steps below:

- For Windows Users:
  1. Press `Win + S` to open search.
  2. Type in `Terminal` and open the terminal.
  3. Key in `java --version` and press `Enter` to check your Java version.

- For macOS Users:
  1. Press `Cmd + Space` to launch Spotlight.
  2. Type in `Terminal` and open the terminal.
  3. Key in `java --version` and press `Return` to check your Java version.

- For Linux Users:
  1. Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open the Terminal.
  2. Key in `java --version` and press `Enter` to check your Java version.


The following image shows an example of what will show up on macOS. You can expect a similar result if you’re using another operating system.
![System Java Version](images/ug/SystemJavaVersion.png){: .centered-image-full-size }

The number in the red box highlights the Java version your system currently has.
In the example, the system is running Java 11.0.19, which meets the requirement for ToothTracker.

If you hava an earlier version of Java installed, head over to
[Oracle's Java download page](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) to install the correct version of Java.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous ToothTracker home folder.

**Q**: I don't have Java 11, how do I install it on my computer?<br>
**A**: You can find detailed installation instructions [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A)
and install Java 11 according to your platform.

**Q**: Why do I get an error while trying to edit an existing dentist/patient?<br>
**A**: The dentist/patient to be edited may not be shown in ToothTracker.
To display the to-be-edited dentist/patient, you may use these commands:
1. `list-dentist` or `list-patient`
2. `search-dentist` or `search-patient`

Thereafter, you may edit the particulars using `edit-dentist` or `edit-patient` with their `DENTIST_ID` or `PATIENT_ID`
respectively.

**Q**: Why are some appointments missing from the calendar view?<br>
**A**: You might have used `view-calendar` after filtering the appointment list. To display all appointments,
you may use `list-appointment` before using `view-calendar`.

## Known issues


### Multi-screen Display:

- **Issue:** When moving the application from a secondary screen to the primary screen, the GUI may open off-screen.
- **Remedy:** Delete the `preferences.json` file before relaunching the application.

### List Treatment Command:

- **Issue:** Extra comma displayed at the end when using the `list-treatment` command.

### Incomplete Treatment Information:

- **Issue:** The `list-treatment` command only displays the names of treatments without additional information such as the cost of treatment and duration, which were fields requested during the initial addition of treatments into ToothTracker.

### Phone Number Validation:

- **Issue:** Validation checks for phone numbers in `add-patient` and `add-dentist` commands are currently based on 8 digits and do not verify if the phone number starts with an 8 or 9.

### Filter Command Validation:

- **Issue:** The `filter-patient` and `filter-dentist` commands only perform validation checks on the attribute to filter by and not the keywords. For example, `filter-dentist a/phone k/myphone` will still execute the command.

### Tag Error in Edit Commands:

- **Issue:** When using non-alphanumeric characters in tags on the `edit-dentist` or `edit-patient` commands, an "Unknown command" error is sometimes displayed.

### Limited Tag Editing:

- **Issue:** If a patient was initially added to ToothTracker with 3 tags, only 3 tags can be edited afterward—no more, no less. Additional tags cannot be added, and attempting to edit with a different number of tags results in an error.
- **Remedy:** To modify tags, the number must exactly match the tags initially assigned during patient creation via `add-patient`. If additional tags are required or if tags need removal, the patient or dentist must be deleted and added again. 
Resetting tags to empty using `edit-patient [PATIENT_ID] t/` is possible, but subsequent tag editing must adhere to the original number of tags.

### Editing Patient Without Tags or Editing Patient previously deleted:

- **Issue:** Attempting to edit a patient record that originally had no tags and adding tags during the edit or editing a patient record that was previously deleted to have tags will result in a "Multiple values specified for the following single-valued field(s): t/" error.
When editing a patient record that initially had no tags, adding tags during the editing process triggers an error related to the `t/` (tags) field. The system recognizes this as an attempt to assign multiple values to a field that is intended to be single-valued.
- **Remedy:** To avoid this error, ensure that the patient record has at least one tag during the initial creation. If tags need to be added later, consider deleting the patient and adding them again with the desired tags.
